<h3> My family</h3>
<p>Furthermore, I am the youngest of a family of 5. My dads name is <b>Carlos Galarza</b> and my mothers is <b> Annette Valentin</b>. I have two older sisters, the eldest is <b> Jacqueline Galarza</b> and the other is <b> Karyann Galarza</b>. </p> 
<p>This is a fairly old picture of our family but I had trouble finding a more recent one. Anyways, my parents are the two on the left and my eldest sister <i> Jacqueline</i> is the one that is next to me with the long black hair and bangs and <i>Karyann</i> is the one sitting in the middle with the bangs and short blonde hair.</p>
