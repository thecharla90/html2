<h3> My family</h3>
<p>Furthermore, I am the youngest of a family of 5. My dads name is <b>Carlos Galarza</b> and my mothers is <b> Annette Valentin</b>. I have two older sisters, the eldest is <b> Jacqueline Galarza</b> and the other is <b> Karyann Galarza</b>. </p> 
<p>This is a fairly old picture of our family but I had trouble finding a more recent one. Anyways, my parents are the two on the left and my eldest sister <i> Jacqueline</i> is the one that is next to me with the long black hair and bangs and <i>Karyann</i> is the one sitting in the middle with the bangs and short blonde hair.</p>

<h4>My friends</h4>

<h5> My best friend</h5>
<p>My best friend's name is <b>Amber</b>and she is a little older than I am but it doesnt matter because she is like a sister to me. I met her when I first moved to Texas and we clicked since the first time we ever spoke. Since then we have been inseperable and we have been through it all together. A few years ago she moved with her husband to Canada and lived there for a couple of years and now she lives with him and her family. Although, she isn't physically here with me we are always there for each other and anytime I have a problem I know I can always count on her.

<h6>My friend</h6>
<p> Another close friend of mine that does live here is called <b>Cassandra</b>. We have sleepovers a lot and we hang out as much as we are able to. Sometimes in between our classes we meet up to chill together. She is really funny we joke a lot together, especially when we watch movies somehow we always make a joke out of everything. However, if the moment comes to it we can always talk seriously as well, which is nice. She is one of the first people I met when I moved to Texas as well. <i>Amber, Cassandra</i>and I all went to high school together. So we all know each other and talk to each other, which is awesome.</p>
